Our paper [FACTS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09480) has been accepted to [Eurographics 2024](https://dlold.eg.org/bitstream/handle/10.2312/egs20241017/02_egs20241017.pdf). This work looks at 3D facial animation style transfer. We are able to take an input animation in one style (this could be emotional style or person-specific style) and convert it into another style while maintaining lip-sync.

My first ever, first author paper [READ Avatars](https://readavatars.github.io/) has been accepted as an oral to [BMVC2023](https://bmvc2023.org/). In this paper we look to bring emotional conditioning into audio-driven talking head generation. We do this through the use of a 3DMM and neural rendering and encounter a few difficulties that require novel components to solve. More detail can be found in the [arxiv preprint](https://bmvc2023.org/) and my blog post in [Towards AI](https://pub.towardsai.net/read-avatars-realistic-emotion-controllable-audio-driven-avatars-1351e1fdfee2).

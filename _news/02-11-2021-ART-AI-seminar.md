title: I ran a conference for ART-AI
inline: false
---

From September 16th - 18th, I organised and hosted an in person student conference for ART-AI. This involved fantastic talks from [Deepmind](https://deepmind.com/), [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/), [DesAcc](https://desacc.com/) and [Spin Up Science](https://www.spin-up.science/).

The conference ended with a fun mini-hackathon involving self-driving cars. Full details can be found [here](https://cdt-art-ai.ac.uk/news/art-ai-news/student-conference-2/).

    A simple, elegant caption looks good between image rows, after each row, or doesn't have to be there at all.

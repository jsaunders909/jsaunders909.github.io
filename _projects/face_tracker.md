To learn style, we need data. In particular, we need 4D data. 4D data is 3D meshes at video rate. This sort of data is very hard to come by. Therefore, I have created a facial tracker that allows for the reconstruction of parametric meshes from video.

I am using the [FLAME model](https://flame.is.tue.mpg.de/) as a basis for this work.

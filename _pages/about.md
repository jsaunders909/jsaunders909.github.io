Hi! I'm Jack, a PhD student at the University of Bath. I'm fortunate to be supervised by [Vinay Namboodiri](https://vinaypn.github.io/) and [Darren Cosker](https://www.cs.bath.ac.uk/~dpc/). I'm a part of [ART-AI](https://cdt-art-ai.ac.uk/) and [CAMERA](https://www.camera.ac.uk/). I'm currently on placement with [Epic Games](https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/home).

My research is centred around deep learning in facial animation. In particular, I'm looking at *style* in facial animation, with the ultimate goal of seamlessly applying existing animations to new faces with no artistic skill.

There is quite a bit of overlap between this research and deepfakes. It is my belief that best method of combatting the harms associated with
deepfakes is education. That's why I'm running [a blog](/blog/:year/:title/) to explain both the dangers of deepfakes, as well as an overview of
how they really work.

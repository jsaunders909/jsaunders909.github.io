Hi! I'm Jack, a PhD student at the University of Bath. I'm fortunate to be supervised by [Vinay Namboodiri](https://vinaypn.github.io/) and [Darren Cosker](https://www.cs.bath.ac.uk/~dpc/). I'm a part of [ART-AI](https://cdt-art-ai.ac.uk/) and [CAMERA](https://www.camera.ac.uk/) and have worked on internship with Epic Games.

My research is centred around deep learning for Digital Humans. In particular, I'm looking at *style* in 3D facial animation, both emotional and idiosyncratic. The ultimate aim of my research is to allow for the creation and editing of animation without the need for artistic skill or expensive performance capture systems. In addition to style, my work touches on 3D reconstruction, speech driven animation, neural rendering and audio-visual joint modelling.

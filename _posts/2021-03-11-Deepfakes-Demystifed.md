You've almost certainly seen deepfakes before. The term "deepfake" refers to a few
related techniques that enable realistic looking fake content of humans. Face-swapping
and face-puppeteering are probably the best known, but the term deepfake can also
apply to voices or bodies.     

Deepfakes are rapidly becoming indistinguishable from reality. From
[resurrecting dead actors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gg1LPc6WUdM) to
[letting David Beckham speak 9 languages](https://www.synthesia.io/post/david-beckham),
the use cases are fascinating. However, the risks and harms they present far more
significant. Misinformation, non-consensual pornography, scams and countless other
nefarious uses have either been speculated about by researchers or have actually occurred.  
What's even worse, is that where making deepfakes used to require a large team of
academics, artists and animators, they can now be made by anyone with a decent PC
and an internet connection.

There are methods that exist to expose deepfakes, but there is an arms race between
such methods and the deepfakes themselves. As deepfakes use AI, any detection method
can be used to train a new iteration of deepfake models. This means that deepfake
detection is a losing battle. So what can be done?

It is my belief that deepfakes will become virtually undetectable. This really only
leaves a couple of choices for reducing the potential harms. In my opinion, the
best way of doing this is through **education**. Only by exposing the public to
the reality of deepfakes do we stand a chance of stopping the spread of misinformation.

This blog exists to educate. It will cover deepfakes from many angles; discussing
the good and the bad, as well as explaining how deepfakes actually work. In doing so
I hope to raise awareness and make people stop and question what they see before
believing.
